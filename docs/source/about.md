## About


### About Pypims

Pypims is a further development of the open-source software [hipims-cuda](https://github.com/HEMLab/hipims). It provides an user friendly Python-based integrated toolchain to prepare the inputs, run flood simulations and visualise the outputs.

### About HiPIMS-CUDA

hipims-cuda is an open source flood Modelling suite developed and maintained by Prof Qiuhua Liang and his team in Loughborough University. hipims-cuda uses state-of-art numerical schemes (Godunov-type finite volume) to solve the 2D shallow water equations for flood simulations. To support high-resolution flood simulations, hipims-cuda is implemented on multiple GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit) using CUDA/C++ languages to achieve high-performance computing.
